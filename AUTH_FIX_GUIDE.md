# Authentication Persistence Fix ‚úÖ

## Problem

When users logged in after scanning a QR code, the system would ask them to login again even though they were already authenticated.

## Root Cause

The authentication state in the React context wasn't properly triggering re-renders in the QRMenuPage component after successful login. The token was stored in localStorage, but the UI didn't update to reflect the authenticated state.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Login Success Callback

Updated `QRMenuPage.jsx` to properly handle login success:

- Added delay to ensure auth context updates
- Force refresh of customer points and active orders
- Trigger auth state re-check

### 2. Custom Event System

Added a custom event system in `MultiAuthContext.jsx`:

- Dispatches `authStateChanged` event when login succeeds
- All components can listen for this event
- Ensures immediate UI updates across the app

### 3. Event Listener in QRMenuPage

Added event listener to detect auth state changes:

- Listens for `authStateChanged` events
- Automatically refreshes data when customer logs in
- Forces component re-render to show authenticated state

## How to Test

### Test Case 1: Login from QR Menu

1. Scan a QR code (or navigate to `/t/{qrSlug}`)
2. Click the "Login" button in the header
3. Enter credentials and login
4. **Expected:** Login button should immediately change to "Logout"
5. **Expected:** User name should appear in the center of header
6. **Expected:** Points should be displayed if available

### Test Case 2: Login Persistence

1. Login from QR menu page
2. Navigate to checkout
3. Go back to QR menu page
4. **Expected:** Should still show as logged in
5. **Expected:** No login prompt should appear

### Test Case 3: Refresh Page

1. Login from QR menu page
2. Refresh the browser (F5)
3. **Expected:** Should remain logged in
4. **Expected:** User info should persist

### Test Case 4: Multiple Tabs

1. Open QR menu in Tab 1
2. Login in Tab 1
3. Open same QR menu in Tab 2
4. **Expected:** Tab 2 should show logged in state
5. Switch back to Tab 1
6. **Expected:** Tab 1 should still show logged in

## Technical Details

### Files Modified

1. `src/pages/customer/QRMenuPage.jsx`

   - Enhanced `onSuccess` callback in CustomerLoginModal
   - Added `authStateChanged` event listener
   - Added force re-render mechanism

2. `src/context/MultiAuthContext.jsx`
   - Added custom event dispatch on successful login
   - Set axios header immediately after login
   - Improved state update timing

### Key Changes

#### QRMenuPage.jsx

```javascript
// Enhanced login success handler
onSuccess={() => {
  console.log("üéâ Login successful! Refreshing auth state...");
  setShowCustomerLogin(false);
  setTimeout(() => {
    fetchCustomerPoints();
    fetchActiveOrders();
    setAuthChecked(false);
    setTimeout(() => setAuthChecked(true), 100);
  }, 300);
}}

// Event listener for auth changes
window.addEventListener("authStateChanged", handleAuthStateChange);
```

#### MultiAuthContext.jsx

```javascript
// Dispatch custom event after login
window.dispatchEvent(
  new CustomEvent("authStateChanged", {
    detail: { type, isAuthenticated: true, user: userData },
  })
);

// Set axios header immediately
axios.defaults.headers.common["Authorization"] = `Bearer ${data.token}`;
```

## Debugging

If you still see issues, check the browser console for these logs:

### Successful Login Flow:

```
[MultiAuth] Logging in as customer...
[MultiAuth] Login successful for customer
[MultiAuth] Sessions updated: {...}
[MultiAuth] Current session type set to: customer
üéâ Login successful! Refreshing auth state...
üîî Auth state changed event received: {...}
‚úÖ Customer logged in, refreshing data...
```

### Auth State Check:

```
üîç QRMenuPage Auth State: {
  authLoading: false,
  isCustomerAuthenticated: true,
  authChecked: true,
  ...
}
```

## Rollback Instructions

If you need to rollback these changes:

1. Revert `src/pages/customer/QRMenuPage.jsx`:

   - Remove the `authStateChanged` event listener
   - Simplify the `onSuccess` callback

2. Revert `src/context/MultiAuthContext.jsx`:
   - Remove the `window.dispatchEvent` call
   - Remove immediate axios header setting

## Additional Notes

- The fix uses a 300ms delay to ensure the auth context has fully updated
- Custom events are used instead of props to avoid prop drilling
- The solution is backward compatible with existing code
- No database or API changes required

## Support

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Verify localStorage has `customer_token` after login
3. Check Network tab for failed API requests
4. Clear browser cache and try again
